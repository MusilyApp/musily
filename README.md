### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Flutter installed. You can find installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

---

### Tested On

Musily has been tested and works seamlessly on the following platforms:

- **Flutter SDK**: 3.29.3
- **Operating Systems**:
  - **Debian 13 Trixie** (GNOME)
  - **Kubuntu 25.04** (KDE)
  - **Windows 11**

Make sure you have the correct Flutter version and system dependencies installed for an optimal experience.

### Linux Setup

> **Note:** The system tray feature requires `libayatana-appindicator3` (or `libappindicator-gtk3`). This has been tested on Debian 13 (GNOME). Functionality on other desktop environments or distributions may vary.

Musily is compatible with most Linux-based distributions. To ensure the app functions properly when building or running from source, please install the following required dependencies.

**Required Dependencies**:

The following libraries must be installed:

- **libmpv**: For audio playback using MPV media player.
- **libsecret**: For secure storage of user credentials and sensitive information.
- **libjsoncpp**: Required for JSON handling (dependency of Flutter Secure Storage).
- **gnome-keyring**: Provides the backend service for `libsecret`.
- **libayatana-appindicator3 / libappindicator-gtk3**: For system tray integration.

#### Install Dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libmpv-dev libsecret-1-dev libjsoncpp-dev gnome-keyring libayatana-appindicator3-dev
```

#### Install Dependencies on Other Linux Distributions

- **Fedora/RHEL (Not Tested)**:

```bash
sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install mpv-devel libsecret-devel jsoncpp-devel gnome-keyring libappindicator-gtk3-devel
```

- **Arch/Manjaro (Not Tested)**:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu mpv libsecret jsoncpp gnome-keyring libappindicator-gtk3
```
